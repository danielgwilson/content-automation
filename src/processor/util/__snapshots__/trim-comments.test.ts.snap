One day, I helped this old dude out - he musta been late 50s, early 60s (long hair, definitely an old hippie). He asked if I wanted to have a cig, as I was heading to my break. We were standing there having a smoke when I asked if he wanted to smoke a bowl in my car. He was down.  
We got to chatting, the dude said he hadnt had LSD in like 30 years. I pull out my bag, give him 4 free sugarcubes and said \\"have fun, you deserve it\\" (his sale got me a fat commission).  
He came back weeks later. He hugged me and told me his 'old lady' and him had one of the best days they've had in decades. Forced me to take $100, which was way more than the drugs were valued. He insisted. He was sooo happy. I walked him out to my car, gave him some more, and I've never seen him since. I still think about him. He was a genuine human.  
  
LSD changes lives. Just make sure you're in a good state of mind.  
Just make sure its LSD and not that 2CB stuff or any other random hallucinogen.

However, in his bin, wrapped in tissue paper I'll find a torn off section of paper with a room number and presumably time written on it.

Aside from sleeping with her students (and others she‚Äôd pick up on Casual Encounters), she showed me her toy collection (which was extensive) and gave me a set of binoculars and asked if I wanted to join her on Saturday night when she liked to watch the kids having sex in their dorm rooms. I politely declined. Maybe I made a face or something because she tried to make me feel more comfortable by asking me if I‚Äôd like a drink. I accepted (normally I‚Äôd say no, but I had to ask her something relating to her kids I don‚Äôt remember what). Anyway, we sit on the couch and she pours me some wine and then says, ‚ÄúI know‚Äù with a big smile. She stood up. I got a little nervous.

Eventually we find everything.

Mainly where the sex toys are, where dad hides all his empty energy drink cans, where mom stores all her shopping purchases with tags still on them... parents in general hide their unusual items in the most usual places. Simple boxes in bedroom drawers, in random linen closets, mostly readily able to find and just out of they way (I've helped move several families and doing the checks for packing has gotten some interesting results)

We know when the parents are tired and dont want to come home. We know sometimes the bar trips the parent takes before coming home.

We know schedules that they say are the reason aren't really the reason

We know personal preferences they have over the years to any random assortment of thing. Seriously who buys mayo to put on everything as their condiment of choice? 

Some things that we know, they know we do and accept it. Alot of the stuff we know, we find out and DEFINITELY play dumb with.

First milestones in nannying are a big one. Keep that to the parents finding the first tooth we found days ago, the walking steps they took yesterday were really the first today. Why take those moments from parents needlessly is our perspective.

Housekeeping is usually the who is dirtiest. I know which parent doesnt brush their teeth every day. Which parent is having an affair with a coworker and left behind a recognizable item on accident.

We know that they dont even consider or think much about us knowing all these things.

The worst was accidentally listening to my bosses get it on. They had left the monitor for the baby in their room. It was not turned off and they to this day do not know I heard them (and turned off the monitor) lol",

      "body": "Not a housekeeper, but a petsitter. I'm not going through people drawers and shit, but just being in people's houses has taught me a lot about how people are.

My wealthier clients tend to be extremely unhappy with their lives. I've got marriages that are complete shams and spouses who cover up this fact by filling their home with endless amounts of useless shit. These people have so much money that they can just drown their sorrows by hoarding objects instead of dealing with their actual issues. Their animals tend to be extremely stand offish or extremely needy, and they're always horribly untrained. And this is usually because they buy animals just cause they can. There's a void and they fill it with an animal that I then take care of for them. 

My lower class clients tend to be genuinely happy. Their houses are usually kind of falling apart and their cars are decades old, but they've got cute notes around to house to their children or spouses and the layout of their living / bed room is intimate and cozy. Their animals are decently trained and friendly most of the time. And this is usually because they devote time and energy into training and loving it rather than locking it in the backyard with a bowl of water from 9-5. 

The point I'm making is mostly about the rich people. They don't know that I know how secretly unhappy they are. They don't know that I know that their marriage is failing, their children don't want to come by to see them anymore, and their trips to moms house are more of a call for help than a vacation. Obviously I'm not saying that rich people can't be happy, but my petsitting experiences have led me to make many, many conclusions about how people with money are generally less capable of actually fixing the problems in their lives and tend to just bury them instead.",

The lady would always leave me a cooked lunch for when I came over, and explicit instructions written on the top of the cling wrap for how long to microwave it. Their house was just a few steps down from a mansion. Five bedrooms, four bathrooms. It usually took a good three hours just to finish all the vacuuming and dusting. One day they had a room closed and locked that had always been open before. Their treadmills and old people dumbbells were in there. No note or anything on the door about leaving it alone, and since I had a universal key, I didn't give it a second thought and went in. Didn't find anything unusual apart from a large-ish box on the treadmill. Picked it up to dust off, and the bottom gives way. Out fall about ten different sex toys. A purple dildo that must have been a foot-and-a-half long, clearly used nipple clamps, and a fleshlight with \\"ARNOLD\\" sharpied on it were among the things I had to very carefully put back in the box to place it elsewhere. Dusted the room and vacuumed it, trying the whole time to erase the contents of that box from my memory. I finish that up, and feeling a bit peckish, decide to take that time to go eat lunch. Two chicken breasts with a side of celery greeted me in the dining room. The cling wrap had two notes on it, the first of which read \\"microwave for 1:30 on HIGH, sauces in fridge.\\" The second, which was clearly written very hastily by the husband, read \\"You should have put a serious tag on this question.\\"",
