We were standing there having a smoke when I asked if he wanted to smoke a bowl in my car. He was down.  \nWe got to chatting, the dude said he hadnt had LSD in like 30 years. I pull out my bag, give him 4 free sugarcubes and said \"have fun, you deserve it\" (his sale got me a fat commission).  \nHe came back weeks later. He hugged me and told me his 'old lady' and him had one of the best days they've had in decades. Forced me to take $100, which was way more than the drugs were valued. He insisted. He was sooo happy. I walked him out to my car, gave him some more, and I've never seen him since. I still think about him. He was a genuine human.  \n  \nLSD changes lives.

I've got marriages that are complete shams and spouses who cover up this fact by filling their home with endless amounts of useless shit. These people have so much money that they can just drown their sorrows by hoarding objects instead of dealing with their actual issues. Their animals tend to be extremely stand offish or extremely needy, and they're always horribly untrained. And this is usually because they buy animals just cause they can. There's a void and they fill it with an animal that I then take care of for them. \n\nMy lower class clients tend to be genuinely happy. Their houses are usually kind of falling apart and their cars are decades old, but they've got cute notes around to house to their children or spouses and the layout of their living / bed room is intimate and cozy. Their animals are decently trained and friendly most of the time. And this is usually because they devote time and energy into training and loving it rather than locking it in the backyard with a bowl of water from 9-5. \n\nThe point I'm making is mostly about the rich people. They don't know that I know how secretly unhappy they are. They don't know that I know that their marriage is failing, their children don't want to come by to see them anymore, and their trips to moms house are more of a call for help than a vacation.

      "body": "A whooooole lot. My favorite story is this old couple. Mid-70s, inseparable, and couldn't be sweeter if they were covered in sugar. The lady would always leave me a cooked lunch for when I came over, and explicit instructions written on the top of the cling wrap for how long to microwave it. Their house was just a few steps down from a mansion. Five bedrooms, four bathrooms. It usually took a good three hours just to finish all the vacuuming and dusting. One day they had a room closed and locked that had always been open before. Their treadmills and old people dumbbells were in there. No note or anything on the door about leaving it alone, and since I had a universal key, I didn't give it a second thought and went in. Didn't find anything unusual apart from a large-ish box on the treadmill. Picked it up to dust off, and the bottom gives way. Out fall about ten different sex toys. A purple dildo that must have been a foot-and-a-half long, clearly used nipple clamps, and a fleshlight with \"ARNOLD\" sharpied on it were among the things I had to very carefully put back in the box to place it elsewhere. Dusted the room and vacuumed it, trying the whole time to erase the contents of that box from my memory. I finish that up, and feeling a bit peckish, decide to take that time to go eat lunch. Two chicken breasts with a side of celery greeted me in the dining room. The cling wrap had two notes on it, the first of which read \"microwave for 1:30 on HIGH, sauces in fridge.\" The second, which was clearly written very hastily by the husband, read \"You should have put a serious tag on this question.\"",
