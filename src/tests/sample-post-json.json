            "body": "When my daughter was seven weeks old, I was going out to the coffee shop around the block from my house. It was a rainy day, but had stopped briefly. \n\nI put her in my Moby Wrap and went out. I went and got coffee and a sandwich. On my way back home, I went to step up onto the sidewalk. Instead my toe clipped the curb. I fell forward. My daughter was thrown out of the wrap and onto the sidewalk. \n\nLuckily I was closer to the ground as I was falling as well, and the fall wasn’t as far as it could’ve been. She began to cry immediately and all I could do was sit on the wet sidewalk, rocking back and forth crying, as a woman was standing next to me saying, “oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god.” \n\nI didn’t have my cell phone with me bc I was just running out. A kind gentleman let me use his and I called my husband who was working around the block. He was there in seconds. \n\nWe went to the emergency room. Got lots of tests done. Watched as my seven week old daughter was placed in a CT scan, I felt so helpless.\n\nShe was completely fine. It was the worst day of my life. I can still close my eyes and see her falling to the ground. \n\nAlthough this experience was terrifying, it taught me some important lessons: kids are resilient, if they cry immediately they’re probably okay, if they move immediately they’re probably okay, you’re gonna eff things up as a parent so be easy on yourself.",

I then went to my bedroom and grabbed a bat to finish the job. Uncle pretty much tackled me when I came out of my room with the bat and took it away. He peed blood for a few weeks after that and never touched me again. Sadly he's still around and still a total piece of shit that should have died thirty years ago.",

He&amp;#39;s at our house for some reason and slaps me across the face and walked away. I saw red. I&amp;#39;m tiny, but I punched him so hard in the left kidney that it dropped him. I then went to my bedroom and grabbed a bat to finish the job. Uncle pretty much tackled me when I came out of my room with the bat and took it away. He peed blood for a few weeks after that and never touched me again. Sadly he&amp;#39;s still around and still a total piece of shit that should have died thirty years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

My sister immediately broke down into having sobs, howling at the top of her lungs as though someone had died, and you can probably guess where it went from there.\n\nShe confessed that her teacher's son, who was a sophomore when my sister was in seventh grade, had assaulted her and when she tried to tell the teacher about it, he shut her down and called her a liar and had said he would fail her if she tried to tell anyone about it.\n\nI had to spend the following day in class with this asshole while my parents sorted out how to handle the situation and it took everything I had not to lose my shit on this kid. I am not a violent person but I had to sit there with him a foot away and all I could think about was smashing his face into the tile until the light left his eyes.\n\nThat was over ten years ago and he's in jail now but I still think I'd have to contain myself if I was in the same room as him again.",

I had been gone for about a month and when I came back they told me about a guy who had been sneaking into the girls dormitory and raping some of them. The girls were so scared that they wouldn’t sleep. These girls were all between 1-12 years old. All of the other staff were women and the guy would physically overpower them when they tried to stop him from getting in the dorm. I am a paramedic by profession so I have a bit of a personal respect and value for human life but this guy had crossed so many lines. I went to the local police and asked them for help and they told me to deal with it. I waited right inside the door of the girls dorm until about 2 AM with a large bamboo pole. I didn’t want to kill him but honestly I didn’t have any problem if it came to that. As soon as I saw the door open I rushed him and knocked him over the porch railing. He had a machete but he dropped it when I tackled him. I jumped over the railing and started beating him as hard as I could. I am not a tiny guy and I also have combat training so I was quite effective. He fought back but I had the size advantage and I was raging. After about 2 minutes I realized that I had broken my hand and quickly grabbed the bamboo pole and swung it around as he tried to get up and run away. It nailed him in the side of his head and sliced most of his right ear off. I swung again and it k Ickes him out. He ended up with a broken nose, left cheek, missing ear, dislocated right shoulder and broken left arm and hand. I broke all of the fingers in his left hand as well. I stopped just short of killing him, but not because I didn’t want to. I knew that if I did kill him I would have to live with that and I didn’t want to give him that power. I already have a ton of guilt just from patients who have died in the field or in the ambulance, I couldn’t bear to kill someone in cold blood like that even if I was justified. I ended up walking away with just a broken right hand and some bruises and sprains. The girls got to sleep though. To this day he hasn’t been back.\n\nTL;DR  I almost killed a child rapist that terrorized an orphanage",

I found out among many other things she had been talking really horrible things about me behind my back. Anyway, one day it all just became too much to handle when she would not stop talking and talking about nothing and I just wanted a moment of peace so I got up and walked to the kitchen and she started yelling out to be from the lounge and I stood in the kitchen, hands on the sink, eyes closed, for probably 5 minutes with her voice echoing in the background. Eventually i picked up a knife and I'll be honest I was going to kill her, no doubt in my mind. Only thing that stopped me was the idea of wasting my life in prison for someone like her so I put the knife down, took a few deep breaths and walked back into the loungeroom. I know it's not a great look for me but please, don't invision a sweet old lady sitting in a rocky chair just wanting to talk, no...she is still to this day the worst person I have ever met, she is toxic on a fundamental level. She just sends people to their absolute limits.",

Anyway, one day it all just became too much to handle when she would not stop talking and talking about nothing and I just wanted a moment of peace so I got up and walked to the kitchen and she started yelling out to be from the lounge and I stood in the kitchen, hands on the sink, eyes closed, for probably 5 minutes with her voice echoing in the background. Eventually i picked up a knife and I&amp;#39;ll be honest I was going to kill her, no doubt in my mind. Only thing that stopped me was the idea of wasting my life in prison for someone like her so I put the knife down, took a few deep breaths and walked back into the loungeroom. I know it&amp;#39;s not a great look for me but please, don&amp;#39;t invision a sweet old lady sitting in a rocky chair just wanting to talk, no...she is still to this day the worst person I have ever met, she is toxic on a fundamental level. She just sends people to their absolute limits.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Hypocrites!\n\nI ended up deciding that ALS has more training then me (three years versus three months of school) and get better differentiate which patients need ALS, and which patients don’t, and that it’s better to keep ALS on a non-critical patient and save a life, then to cancel ALS on a critical patient and kill a person.\n\nIf they wanna bitch they can bitch but at the end of the day if they really think i don’t need them they can triage to me.

Thought I was doing everyone a favor, saving him $3000, freeing up the medics for more critical patients - to my eyes he seemed manageable for the twenty minute ride to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead I almost killed a guy and got a massive lecture from the responding paramedic on “canceling ALS on patients that need ALS.” Same Paramedics that gave me the “don’t keep us if you don’t need us” lecture. Hypocrites!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up deciding that ALS has more training then me (three years versus three months of school) and get better differentiate which patients need ALS, and which patients don’t, and that it’s better to keep ALS on a non-critical patient and save a life, then to cancel ALS on a critical patient and kill a person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they wanna bitch they can bitch but at the end of the day if they really think i don’t need them they can triage to me. Assholes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
