Anyways we had just started a brine pond project an had just hired some new laborers. They were as green as they come lol. Anyways ,I used my two way radio to ask them to come over to where I was to tear down a set or barricades so I could proceed. One of the laborers literally ran right up beside my machine without making direct eye contact or radio contact(industry standard is to do so I can safe out the machine). I was backing up at the time so I was watching behind my machine. When I turned around to go forward the laborer literally 2 inches from my tracks...Needless to say I've never pressed the engine decal pedal as fast as I did in that situation.. if I was new to the machine or inexperienced the guy would have been an empty tooth paste roll on the ground",

I was 16 at a park with my sister. She was off doing something on her phone and there were probably about 4-5 other families there with kids of various age.

I got on the swings and was swinging there for about 15 minutes before I decided to kick myself up higher and start swinging at *peak* height. Just as I swung backwards, I see a kid no older than 4-5 right smack in the middle of my swing, standing right in the pit of dirt where kids feet would kick up. He was just smiling and staring at me.

I remember everything past that point being slow motion. I start to come down, panic, launched myself off the seat backwards, smacking my head into the gravel and knocking the wind out of me. Just as I look up, **DINK!** I see the little kid get smacked directly in the mouth with the seat of my swing, fall over and begin HOWLING crying.

I remember the father yelling at me over and over, balling up a fist as if he’s about to punch a 16 year old. Kids are fucking stupid dude",

Ransacked my cupboards, couldn't find it. Next best thing that came to mind? Dirt from outside, ran outside to get some dirt, told her not to pour water on it that I'll be right back. As I'm out there I hear her scream and a flash of orange. My heart sank and I froze for a second, did I just kill my date? Back inside, she's fine, fire is smaller but still going, my walls and ceiling are scorched, I ask her what happened? She replied, she poured milk on the fire because milk is thicker than water.

...ok

Anyway, no one was harmed in all this thankfully. Except my bank account when my security deposit didn't cover the damages done when I moved out later. Oh well.

I do have more fire stories from that apartment. Pretty sure my landlord thought I was an arsonist. Or a dumb kid on his first time living alone, pretending to be an adult.

Edit to add: Thank you for the all the \\"put the lid on next time\\" recommendations, I now know that's an option, like I said I was panicking and wasn't thinking straight. I do now have multiple fire extinguishers throughout my current place. They were all were gifted to me by family after I told them this story. Those were fun birthday/Christmas gifts that year!

Also there was no second date and we did not smash lol",

Thankfully, she was fine, but I'm so glad she didn't fell harder or over the handrail, or else she would have fallen at least three meters and would probably be dead.

I put her in my Moby Wrap and went out. I went and got coffee and a sandwich. On my way back home, I went to step up onto the sidewalk. Instead my toe clipped the curb. I fell forward. My daughter was thrown out of the wrap and onto the sidewalk. 

Luckily I was closer to the ground as I was falling as well, and the fall wasn’t as far as it could’ve been. She began to cry immediately and all I could do was sit on the wet sidewalk, rocking back and forth crying, as a woman was standing next to me saying, “oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god.” 

I didn’t have my cell phone with me bc I was just running out. A kind gentleman let me use his and I called my husband who was working around the block. He was there in seconds. 

We went to the emergency room. Got lots of tests done. Watched as my seven week old daughter was placed in a CT scan, I felt so helpless.

She was completely fine. It was the worst day of my life. I can still close my eyes and see her falling to the ground. 

Although this experience was terrifying, it taught me some important lessons: kids are resilient, if they cry immediately they’re probably okay, if they move immediately they’re probably okay, you’re gonna eff things up as a parent so be easy on yourself.",

I also worked with a guy who would work 4 doubles and immediately leave work and drive 5 hours back home. He was about 20 mins from home, made it through the toll booth and woke up in the middle of the I-90, fully stopped, tractor trailers flying by him on both sides. He could’ve been killed, or caused an accident if someone hadn’t realized he was stopped and couldn’t move over or brake in time. He made it 4.5 hours without issue, only to almost die or kill some one 20 mins from home...He started sleeping after his last double and would leave in the morning after that incident.

DO NOT DRIVE IF YOU FEEL TIRED. Pull over and nap if you’ve already started driving. Stay home, if it’s not important you go out. Stay an extra few hours where you are and sleep, if possible.

I said we newd to break down the top bunk into pieces (take the matress off, then the bottom sping bit, etc). She said \\"no, we got this, we can just pick it up as a whole unit\\" I told her I do not posess enough strength to that. She told me it would be fine. 

So we lift this bed whole, straight off the bottom bed pegs. The height difference between us is over a foot. So I kinda dropped it trying to even it out with her end. And shock of all shocks it ended up falling. She was backed against a windowsill. She tripped and fell back and he head caught the windowsill and the bed came down on her. One of the legs caught the sill and her head ended up being trapped between the bottom rung of the bed ladder and the sill. We had to yell and get some help.

If that leg wouldn't have caught the windowsill she would have had the whole weight of the bed come down on her exposed neck. Breaking her neck, probably crushing her throat and who knows what else. Honestly she was literal inches from death, we had to pause and just let that sink in for the rest of the night.

The beds still got moved though.",

I have bipolar and PTSD which caused a lot of serious rage since it was unmanaged at the time, and I think the only thing stopping me was not knowing where he lived at the time since I've never been close to my family. Never felt that kind of rage before or since. The old fucker seems to have poorly managed diabetes so I'm settling with being happy he's suffering for the last years of his life. And honestly glad I never made that confrontation because I was only like 20 at the time and I would still be in prison.

Thankfully she has been able to accept her childhood trauma and not let it rule her life. I honestly think I'm more bothered by it than anyone else in my family, and have even been told I need to learn to forgive him in the spirit of Christianity, even though I'm agnostic. No. I will hate him untilthe day he dies, and only then will I feel true peace about it.",

      "body": "When my younger sister was in middle school, she took a very sudden and unexplained dip in personality. She went from being a bouncy, sunny kid who loved going outside and seeing her friends to kind of reserved and struggling to keep her grades up. Her friends stopped coming around, crazy rumors about her started, and she was just overall really depressed and nervous. Our parents were very into the \\"just suck it up\\" mentality so they told her to just push through and be better. I tried to get her to tell me what had happened and she told me the same thing she told our parents - that kids at school were bullying her and her friends were being mean.

I didn't buy it, but there was nothing I could do.

One day at the dinner table, we were all talking about town gossip as was family custom, and my mom brought up how a teacher at my sister's school was looking for a hand in getting rid of some old furniture from his late father's house and that my mother had volunteered the family to help out that coming weekend. My sister immediately broke down into having sobs, howling at the top of her lungs as though someone had died, and you can probably guess where it went from there.

She confessed that her teacher's son, who was a sophomore when my sister was in seventh grade, had assaulted her and when she tried to tell the teacher about it, he shut her down and called her a liar and had said he would fail her if she tried to tell anyone about it.

I had to spend the following day in class with this asshole while my parents sorted out how to handle the situation and it took everything I had not to lose my shit on this kid. I am not a violent person but I had to sit there with him a foot away and all I could think about was smashing his face into the tile until the light left his eyes.

That was over ten years ago and he's in jail now but I still think I'd have to contain myself if I was in the same room as him again.",

It also had an insanely nice hotel section for visiting family members as well as a very good restaurant on location. It was right on the beach (a beautiful pebble beach) and had extensive of rehab and exercise facilities. They bought in early as it was being built, not sure how else they would have afforded it. It was really more a resort than a nursing home, I was really impressed. 

Then on my mom's side, my grandfather was put in a nursing home in Florida after suffering a stroke. It was supposedly one of the best in the area, but we had a litany of issues similar to what you had. He was doing better until he was left unattended with his bed rails off and fell out of bed. He had also missed doctor's appointments due to the shuttle driver consistently not showing up. The fall eventually killed him but he was ready to go and was moved back home for his last few weeks. We were able to get the director of the place fired, hopefully his replacement was better.",

I had been gone for about a month and when I came back they told me about a guy who had been sneaking into the girls dormitory and raping some of them. The girls were so scared that they wouldn’t sleep. These girls were all between 1-12 years old. All of the other staff were women and the guy would physically overpower them when they tried to stop him from getting in the dorm. I am a paramedic by profession so I have a bit of a personal respect and value for human life but this guy had crossed so many lines. I went to the local police and asked them for help and they told me to deal with it. I waited right inside the door of the girls dorm until about 2 AM with a large bamboo pole. I didn’t want to kill him but honestly I didn’t have any problem if it came to that. As soon as I saw the door open I rushed him and knocked him over the porch railing. He had a machete but he dropped it when I tackled him. I jumped over the railing and started beating him as hard as I could. I am not a tiny guy and I also have combat training so I was quite effective. He fought back but I had the size advantage and I was raging. After about 2 minutes I realized that I had broken my hand and quickly grabbed the bamboo pole and swung it around as he tried to get up and run away. It nailed him in the side of his head and sliced most of his right ear off. I swung again and it k Ickes him out. He ended up with a broken nose, left cheek, missing ear, dislocated right shoulder and broken left arm and hand. I broke all of the fingers in his left hand as well. I stopped just short of killing him, but not because I didn’t want to. I knew that if I did kill him I would have to live with that and I didn’t want to give him that power. I already have a ton of guilt just from patients who have died in the field or in the ambulance, I couldn’t bear to kill someone in cold blood like that even if I was justified. I ended up walking away with just a broken right hand and some bruises and sprains. The girls got to sleep though. To this day he hasn’t been back.

TL;DR  I almost killed a child rapist that terrorized an orphanage",

It definitely lasted a couple minutes. I remember hiding on the couch and thinking that this would be a ridiculous way for him to die. But mostly I was feeling incredibly guilty and stupid for giving him that wine gum.

After a month of this I snapped. I stood on top of my bed listening as his foot steps got closer. As soon as he walked into my room I lunged at him. I  wrapped my hands around his throat.  

As soon as he hit the ground everyone in the  group home came running to see what that sound was. It took several people to pry my hands off that guy’s throat. I was arrested and originally charged with attempted murder. Luckily that kid confessed to raping me repeatedly. I was still charged with assault and battery though.

I spent 2 months in juvenile detention. I was also given 6 months of house arrest and 6 months of probation.",

I forget what exactly started the arguing but she told me she’s be happy to go to my then unborn child’s funeral.

My father and I both told her to get the fuck out, she refused and kept trying to argue about everything. I left and went to my brothers apartment instead because I knew something drastic would’ve happened if I didn’t

We were in his truck and having a vicious alcohol fueled argument.  He was about to get violent with me, trying to grab me and was going to hit me.  (not the first time)  I pulled out my .22 handgun (semi auto) from my coat pocket and  held it to his head.  I seriously considered just ending him.  His attitude changed from aggressive to woah woah woah.  

Decided he wasn't worth it. I had better things to do with my life AND people, family, children,, who depended on me.  He backed off.  So I shot the gun into the ground out of my window. (That felt good and released the anger into innocent dirt)  Got out of the truck and told him to never come back.   Dumped his crap in the yard and changed the locks.

That was ~32 years ago.  Best decision ever. Divorced and didn't kill the bastard.

Edit. Thanks for the replies. Yes. I am doing great.  Got remarried to a wonderful man who is a normal human being. Treats me good. Respects and supports my endeavors, as I do his.  We are still in love after 28 years. (Old people in love...eeeeeewww😆)  I didn't know what a good marriage or relationship was until I found one.  Why did I wait so long? Don't know.",

I snapped. Everything went red. 

I don't remember what led to it but the next thing I remember is holding the guy at arms length by the coller with him crying and crawling at my arms screaming something. Couldn't hear anything. 

What I realised next was I was holding him in the road. 

I looked to my right and saw a bus was coming and the only thing I could think was that the bus was going to take my arms (Plus the guy attached) and was strangely at peace with it. 

Luckily something switched back on in my head, the sound came back and all the peacefulness got turned into panic. Pulled the guy and myself away from the road. 

Stood over him for a bit. Wanted to ask if he was okay but just couldn't speak and just left the guy there on the pavement and walked home numb. Everything felt unreal. 

Once I got home and realised no-one else was in the house I went to the bathroom, threw up, wailed and cryed until I was sore.

Once I had calmed down and stopped being sick I washed my arms from various cuts and scratches. Put on a long sleeve T-Shirt and went to bed. 

For the next couple of weeks I barely spoke to anyone or ate while isolating myself to my room.

Came across the guy a few times as the years went by. He always just walked away quickly and I always felt the strike of guilt.",

Spoke constantly, dribbled shit non stop and it was a small house so there was no getting away from it. I found out among many other things she had been talking really horrible things about me behind my back. Anyway, one day it all just became too much to handle when she would not stop talking and talking about nothing and I just wanted a moment of peace so I got up and walked to the kitchen and she started yelling out to be from the lounge and I stood in the kitchen, hands on the sink, eyes closed, for probably 5 minutes with her voice echoing in the background. Eventually i picked up a knife and I'll be honest I was going to kill her, no doubt in my mind. Only thing that stopped me was the idea of wasting my life in prison for someone like her so I put the knife down, took a few deep breaths and walked back into the loungeroom. I know it's not a great look for me but please, don't invision a sweet old lady sitting in a rocky chair just wanting to talk, no...she is still to this day the worst person I have ever met, she is toxic on a fundamental level.

ALS hates being kept by the basics if they aren’t needed. So they encourage us to cancel when possible.

The time I almost killed someone is when i canceled paramedics (ALS) on a bad respiratory .

This was recent. I thought I could manage him with an nonrebreather (think airplane mask) and had just been given a massive lecture by a paramedic for keeping them on patients that could be managed without ALS. Thought I was doing everyone a favor, saving him $3000, freeing up the medics for more critical patients - to my eyes he seemed manageable for the twenty minute ride to the hospital.

Instead I almost killed a guy and got a massive lecture from the responding paramedic on “canceling ALS on patients that need ALS.” Same Paramedics that gave me the “don’t keep us if you don’t need us” lecture. Hypocrites!

I ended up deciding that ALS has more training then me (three years versus three months of school) and get better differentiate which patients need ALS, and which patients don’t, and that it’s better to keep ALS on a non-critical patient and save a life, then to cancel ALS on a critical patient and kill a person.

If they wanna bitch they can bitch but at the end of the day if they really think i don’t need them they can triage to me. Assholes.",

Who was gaslit and screamed at and berated for not being able to save her world? Me.

In that moment, I have never wanted to actually kill someone as much as I wanted to kill her ex boyfriend for taking the absolute WORST ROUTE POSSIBLE to end a relationship. I see red whenever i think of it.

He absolutely knew he would be killed where he was stationed, but stayed to make sure USGS had early-ish warning.

He and several other volcanologists prevented people from being near the volcano during the few months of pre-eruptive activity, and successfully fought pressure to re-open the area. Their work kept the death toll at a few tens of individuals, instead of the thousands who possibly could have been killed had the region not been sealed off. Johnston supported the lateral blast theory: he believed the explosive eruption would be ejected sideways out of the volcano, not upward. He also believed that the eruption would originate from the bulge. Because of this, he was more aware than most of the threat of a north-directed eruption.

Nobody predicted it except him.",

About a month ago there was a magnitude 6 earthquake centered near a park called Craters of the Moon, which is the site of a ton of dormant volcanoes. That is only about 200 miles away from Yellowstone. The region has since had fairly significant aftershocks multiple times a day. Upwards of magnitude 4 when I last talked to my aunt who lives in the area. There haven't been earthquakes like that in nearly 100 years.",
