Anyways we had just started a brine pond project an had just hired some new laborers. They were as green as they come lol. Anyways ,I used my two way radio to ask them to come over to where I was to tear down a set or barricades so I could proceed. One of the laborers literally ran right up beside my machine without making direct eye contact or radio contact(industry standard is to do so I can safe out the machine). I was backing up at the time so I was watching behind my machine. When I turned around to go forward the laborer literally 2 inches from my tracks...Needless to say I've never pressed the engine decal pedal as fast as I did in that situation.. if I was new to the machine or inexperienced the guy would have been an empty tooth paste roll on the ground",

A bit pedo-creepy - would do things like “accidentally” let his robe gap open with no underwear on, would start tickle fights as an excuse to get gropey, that sort of thing. That was nothing next to the beatings, gaslighting, manipulation and other varieties of psychological and physical torture. I hated him more than I’ve ever hated anyone in my life and one night I decided to try to make rat poison tea. 

Turns out the rat poison we had wouldn’t dissolve in the tea. It’s for the best. He’s still an asshole but at least I’m not a murderer.",

I'm very very happy with how things turned out and as stated many times it was literally the most legal and safe thing I could've done, as was decided in court. Some of you are literally brainwashed to think that your personal property is worth more than a young human life and that's honestly disturbing as fuck.

      "body": "I had started a grease fire in a pot on the stove while cooking for a date. Panic set in as it was  kind of big fire, only thing I could think of was baking soda would be the only thing to put it out because that's what they taught us in school right? Ransacked my cupboards, couldn't find it. Next best thing that came to mind? Dirt from outside, ran outside to get some dirt, told her not to pour water on it that I'll be right back. As I'm out there I hear her scream and a flash of orange. My heart sank and I froze for a second, did I just kill my date? Back inside, she's fine, fire is smaller but still going, my walls and ceiling are scorched, I ask her what happened? She replied, she poured milk on the fire because milk is thicker than water.

...ok

Anyway, no one was harmed in all this thankfully. Except my bank account when my security deposit didn't cover the damages done when I moved out later. Oh well.

I do have more fire stories from that apartment. Pretty sure my landlord thought I was an arsonist. Or a dumb kid on his first time living alone, pretending to be an adult.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit to add: Thank you for the all the \\"put the lid on next time\\" recommendations, I now know that's an option, like I said I was panicking and wasn't thinking straight. I do now have multiple fire extinguishers throughout my current place. They were all were gifted to me by family after I told them this story. Those were fun birthday/Christmas gifts that year!

Also there was no second date and we did not smash lol",

Thankfully, she was fine, but I'm so glad she didn't fell harder or over the handrail, or else she would have fallen at least three meters and would probably be dead.

      "body": "When my daughter was seven weeks old, I was going out to the coffee shop around the block from my house. It was a rainy day, but had stopped briefly. 

I put her in my Moby Wrap and went out. I went and got coffee and a sandwich. On my way back home, I went to step up onto the sidewalk. Instead my toe clipped the curb. I fell forward. My daughter was thrown out of the wrap and onto the sidewalk. 

Luckily I was closer to the ground as I was falling as well, and the fall wasn’t as far as it could’ve been. She began to cry immediately and all I could do was sit on the wet sidewalk, rocking back and forth crying, as a woman was standing next to me saying, “oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god.” 

I didn’t have my cell phone with me bc I was just running out. A kind gentleman let me use his and I called my husband who was working around the block. He was there in seconds. 

We went to the emergency room. Got lots of tests done. Watched as my seven week old daughter was placed in a CT scan, I felt so helpless.

She was completely fine. It was the worst day of my life. I can still close my eyes and see her falling to the ground. 

Although this experience was terrifying, it taught me some important lessons: kids are resilient, if they cry immediately they’re probably okay, if they move immediately they’re probably okay, you’re gonna eff things up as a parent so be easy on yourself.",

She threatened to beat me up, and even threatened that she would kill me. I went to the counselor and she said it was nothing and I should just ignore it. No one wanted to help me.

There was one day she cornered me on the stairs. They were multiple stories and I was on my way to class. She was standing next to the railing, yelling at me. Telling me how worthless I was and I should just jump off the roof to save everyone the annoyance of knowing me.

For a split second I considered pushing her over the railing. We were on the 3rd floor, so I don't know if she would have died or just been severely injured. Regardless, I considered it for 1.5 seconds before I snapped back into reality and just took off down the stairs. 

I've never been a violent person with violent thoughts,   but if she had gotten physical with me I don't know what I would have done. I was 13 at the time and I'm 25 now. I still remember it sometimes and shudder. I've never had a thought like that since.",

I said we newd to break down the top bunk into pieces (take the matress off, then the bottom sping bit, etc). She said \\"no, we got this, we can just pick it up as a whole unit\\" I told her I do not posess enough strength to that. She told me it would be fine. 

So we lift this bed whole, straight off the bottom bed pegs. The height difference between us is over a foot. So I kinda dropped it trying to even it out with her end. And shock of all shocks it ended up falling. She was backed against a windowsill. She tripped and fell back and he head caught the windowsill and the bed came down on her. One of the legs caught the sill and her head ended up being trapped between the bottom rung of the bed ladder and the sill. We had to yell and get some help.

If that leg wouldn't have caught the windowsill she would have had the whole weight of the bed come down on her exposed neck. Breaking her neck, probably crushing her throat and who knows what else. Honestly she was literal inches from death, we had to pause and just let that sink in for the rest of the night.

The beds still got moved though.",

      "body": "When my younger sister was in middle school, she took a very sudden and unexplained dip in personality. She went from being a bouncy, sunny kid who loved going outside and seeing her friends to kind of reserved and struggling to keep her grades up. Her friends stopped coming around, crazy rumors about her started, and she was just overall really depressed and nervous. Our parents were very into the \\"just suck it up\\" mentality so they told her to just push through and be better. I tried to get her to tell me what had happened and she told me the same thing she told our parents - that kids at school were bullying her and her friends were being mean.

I didn't buy it, but there was nothing I could do.

One day at the dinner table, we were all talking about town gossip as was family custom, and my mom brought up how a teacher at my sister's school was looking for a hand in getting rid of some old furniture from his late father's house and that my mother had volunteered the family to help out that coming weekend. My sister immediately broke down into having sobs, howling at the top of her lungs as though someone had died, and you can probably guess where it went from there.

She confessed that her teacher's son, who was a sophomore when my sister was in seventh grade, had assaulted her and when she tried to tell the teacher about it, he shut her down and called her a liar and had said he would fail her if she tried to tell anyone about it.

I had to spend the following day in class with this asshole while my parents sorted out how to handle the situation and it took everything I had not to lose my shit on this kid. I am not a violent person but I had to sit there with him a foot away and all I could think about was smashing his face into the tile until the light left his eyes.

That was over ten years ago and he's in jail now but I still think I'd have to contain myself if I was in the same room as him again.",

So when he was leaving court i absolutely lost it and i ended up getting arrested and serving a 3 year sentence for gbh. Admittedly i went overboard but right there and then i wanted him dead and i think i would've killed had i not been pulled away.",

      "body": "I volunteered at an orphanage in Thailand a couple of years ago. I had been gone for about a month and when I came back they told me about a guy who had been sneaking into the girls dormitory and raping some of them. The girls were so scared that they wouldn’t sleep. These girls were all between 1-12 years old. All of the other staff were women and the guy would physically overpower them when they tried to stop him from getting in the dorm. I am a paramedic by profession so I have a bit of a personal respect and value for human life but this guy had crossed so many lines. I went to the local police and asked them for help and they told me to deal with it. I waited right inside the door of the girls dorm until about 2 AM with a large bamboo pole. I didn’t want to kill him but honestly I didn’t have any problem if it came to that. As soon as I saw the door open I rushed him and knocked him over the porch railing. He had a machete but he dropped it when I tackled him. I jumped over the railing and started beating him as hard as I could. I am not a tiny guy and I also have combat training so I was quite effective. He fought back but I had the size advantage and I was raging. After about 2 minutes I realized that I had broken my hand and quickly grabbed the bamboo pole and swung it around as he tried to get up and run away. It nailed him in the side of his head and sliced most of his right ear off. I swung again and it k Ickes him out. He ended up with a broken nose, left cheek, missing ear, dislocated right shoulder and broken left arm and hand. I broke all of the fingers in his left hand as well. I stopped just short of killing him, but not because I didn’t want to. I knew that if I did kill him I would have to live with that and I didn’t want to give him that power. I already have a ton of guilt just from patients who have died in the field or in the ambulance, I couldn’t bear to kill someone in cold blood like that even if I was justified. I ended up walking away with just a broken right hand and some bruises and sprains. The girls got to sleep though. To this day he hasn’t been back.

TL;DR  I almost killed a child rapist that terrorized an orphanage",

We were in his truck and having a vicious alcohol fueled argument.  He was about to get violent with me, trying to grab me and was going to hit me.  (not the first time)  I pulled out my .22 handgun (semi auto) from my coat pocket and  held it to his head.  I seriously considered just ending him.  His attitude changed from aggressive to woah woah woah.  

Decided he wasn't worth it. I had better things to do with my life AND people, family, children,, who depended on me.  He backed off.  So I shot the gun into the ground out of my window. (That felt good and released the anger into innocent dirt)  Got out of the truck and told him to never come back.   Dumped his crap in the yard and changed the locks.

That was ~32 years ago.  Best decision ever. Divorced and didn't kill the bastard.

Edit. Thanks for the replies. Yes. I am doing great.  Got remarried to a wonderful man who is a normal human being. Treats me good. Respects and supports my endeavors, as I do his.

I don't remember what led to it but the next thing I remember is holding the guy at arms length by the coller with him crying and crawling at my arms screaming something. Couldn't hear anything. 

What I realised next was I was holding him in the road. 

I looked to my right and saw a bus was coming and the only thing I could think was that the bus was going to take my arms (Plus the guy attached) and was strangely at peace with it. 

Luckily something switched back on in my head, the sound came back and all the peacefulness got turned into panic. Pulled the guy and myself away from the road. 

Stood over him for a bit. Wanted to ask if he was okay but just couldn't speak and just left the guy there on the pavement and walked home numb. Everything felt unreal. 

Once I got home and realised no-one else was in the house I went to the bathroom, threw up, wailed and cryed until I was sore.

Once I had calmed down and stopped being sick I washed my arms from various cuts and scratches. Put on a long sleeve T-Shirt and went to bed. 

For the next couple of weeks I barely spoke to anyone or ate while isolating myself to my room.

      "body": "EMT here. In my state we have two different levels of EMT - basic EMT and Paramedic. Basics respond alongside Paramedics and we cancel Paramedics if we don’t need them.

ALS hates being kept by the basics if they aren’t needed. So they encourage us to cancel when possible.

The time I almost killed someone is when i canceled paramedics (ALS) on a bad respiratory .

This was recent. I thought I could manage him with an nonrebreather (think airplane mask) and had just been given a massive lecture by a paramedic for keeping them on patients that could be managed without ALS. Thought I was doing everyone a favor, saving him $3000, freeing up the medics for more critical patients - to my eyes he seemed manageable for the twenty minute ride to the hospital.

Instead I almost killed a guy and got a massive lecture from the responding paramedic on “canceling ALS on patients that need ALS.” Same Paramedics that gave me the “don’t keep us if you don’t need us” lecture. Hypocrites!

I ended up deciding that ALS has more training then me (three years versus three months of school) and get better differentiate which patients need ALS, and which patients don’t, and that it’s better to keep ALS on a non-critical patient and save a life, then to cancel ALS on a critical patient and kill a person.

If they wanna bitch they can bitch but at the end of the day if they really think i don’t need them they can triage to me. Assholes.",

      "body": "It was a period of extreme anxiety and piss poor mental health for me. I was barely hanging on to my own situation. At the time, one of my closest friends was having relationship problems. This friend was far less mentally stable than me but refused to seek professional help and instead used fairly unstable people like me as their “professional help”. Super healthy, I know.

So at my lowest point, her boyfriend decides to cheat on her instead of just breaking up with her. Queue an absolute mental collapse of this ex-friend and who was expected to pick up the pieces and make it all right? Me. Who was gaslit and screamed at and berated for not being able to save her world? Me.

In that moment, I have never wanted to actually kill someone as much as I wanted to kill her ex boyfriend for taking the absolute WORST ROUTE POSSIBLE to end a relationship. I see red whenever i think of it. The last thing in the world I was equipped to do at that time was play friend therapist to a diagnosed manic depressive who manipulated the shit out of people instead of seeking actual help. 

We are no longer friends. I still want to kill her ex boyfriend for that shit.",

Came to find out he'd then spent roughly 3 hours throwing up into a shower drain and nearly had to go to hospital for alcohol poisoning but his dad had arrived and taken him home instead. Came in on the Monday to school genuinely worried I'd be called in to the headmasters office to tell me I'd caused the death of my friend. When I apologised to him for having him down the vodka he just went \\"oh that was you? Ha no way\\" and we are still friends to this day 10 years later",

This was after we agreed that it was her job to put gates up and close doors if she didn't want my dog in her area of the house (it's my apartment, they were renting from me.) Instead, I flipped her table and threw it across the room to function as a barrier since she was unwilling to put any effort in to do so. 

Pretty much everyone I told this story to is shocked I didn't at least hit her. I hate violence with a passion, but man, threaten my dog and my blood boils. I have a new roommate now. she's much better.",
